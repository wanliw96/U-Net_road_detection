# U-Net_road_detection

Automatic road extraction from remote-sensing imagery plays a critical role in many applications. However, accurate and efficient extraction from high-resolution images remains hard because of the image size, spatial diversity for road targets and disturbances (e.g., trees and buildings), etc. The goal of this project is to use U-Net architecture together with data augmentation to execute the fast acquisition of weak road information while avoiding noise.
