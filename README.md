# U-Net_road_detection

Automatic road extraction from remote-sensing imagery plays an important role in many applications. However, accurate and efficient extraction from very high-resolution images remains difficult because of the image size, spatial diversity for road targets and disturbances (e.g., trees and buildings) etc. The goal for this project is to use U-Net architecture together with data augmentation to apply fast-acquisition of weak road information while avoiding noise.
